#### To start exploring our **objective**, I used a line chart 

 
- eche color descibes a educational grade.

|Degree level |Color of line  |
|:------------|:-----------------:|
|Bachelor     |Blue               |
|Diploma      |Red                |
|Doctorate    |Grean              |
|Intermediate |Purple             |
|Master       |Orange
|Primary      |Baby blue 
|Secondary    |Pink secondary 

## After we analyse salary we find 
>- Primary degree was between 1-6K in 2017 and in 2021 decrees to 1-5K  
>- Secondary degree was between 3-8k in 2017 and 1-8k in 2021 
>- Intermediate degree from 2017 until 2021 same between 1-7K 
>- Diploma degree was between 1-9K in 2017 and 3-10K in 2021
>- Bachelor degree was between 6-13K in 2017 and 5-13K in 2021
