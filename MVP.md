To start exploring this **goal**, I used a line chart  salary from 2017 - 2021 with degree level

 


|Degree level |The colore of line |
|:------------|:-----------------:|
|bachelor     |Blue               |
|diploma      |red                |
|doctorate    |grean              |
|intermediate |purple             |
|master       |orange
|primary      |baby blue 
|secondary    |pink secondary
